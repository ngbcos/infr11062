Welcome to DREAMT
=================
**Decoding, Reranking, Evaluation, and Alignment for Machine Translation**

DREAMT consists of baseline components for homework assignments in the 
[University of Edinburgh machine translation class](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mt/).

1. The ALIGNER takes parallel texts and produces word alignments.
2. The DECODER takes source texts and produces target texts.
